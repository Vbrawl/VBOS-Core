***VBOS?***
-----------

VBOS stands for VBrawl's OS (I'm not good with names...) and is (going to be) a general purpose OS. It's going to have server editions and versions with GUI.

It's going to have a lot of features such as, app containerization, 1-process mode, and be more secure than everything else.



***What about the core?***
--------------------------

It's the kernel of VBOS, the main functionality and some drivers are here.


***State***
-----------

We currently have the bootloader and a really basic kernel that, with the help
of some custom drivers, is able to print stuff to the screen.
